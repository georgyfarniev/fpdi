Mission: build convenient and lightweight fp-style dependency injection library

Why FPDI?

- No dependencies
- Framework and language agnostic (both Typescript and Javascript supported)
- Typescript support
- Convenience and simplicity (inspired by react hooks)
- Throwing exception if your dependency not found or same dependency overriden (can be disabled)
